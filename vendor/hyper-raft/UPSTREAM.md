# hyper-raft's shared crates, vendored

The crates Focal's bus is built on (`vendor/focal-bus`), at hyper-raft's `main`.

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/hyper-light/hyper-raft, commit
  `25cf88924895ee55976caa061a48789355fb3354` (2026-10-22), MIT (`LICENSE`): hyper-raft's `main` since
  its `main` and `fate-commit` lines met (the merge `7d5e536`). Focal's `bus-replicated` at `52d17cb`
  takes its shared crates at `d4e8447` (Focal's `vendor/README.md`), and `25cf889` is `d4e8447` and
  four commits that change tests alone, so the bus builds on the same code here, at the revision
  Mantle takes too, and kiln holds one.
- **What is here:** upstream's root manifest and the fifteen crates, whole, at upstream's paths:
  `hyper-block`, `hyper-datagram`, `hyper-durable`, `hyper-liveness`, `hyper-log`, `hyper-measure`,
  `hyper-quic`, `hyper-raft`, `hyper-rt`, `hyper-rt-transport`, `hyper-seal`, `hyper-sim`,
  `hyper-timing`, `hyper-tls`, `hyper-transport`.
- **How it's built:** Quiver's root `Cargo.toml` points the names Focal's bus takes them by at these
  folders (`[patch.crates-io]`); kiln, vendoring Quiver, holds the same revision with the same
  changes, its own crates built on it too.

## Changes from upstream

Each change is recorded in `vendor/patches/hyper-raft/`, applied in this order on upstream's tree.

| File | Change | Why | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crates/hyper-durable/src/lib.rs`, `crates/hyper-durable/Cargo.toml` | `RamStore` compiled only for the crate's own tests or under the `test-store` feature, which a dev-dependency asks for (the crate's own tests ask through one on itself) | the write-ahead log is mandatory in Quiver and kiln: `GroupStore` on a real device, `RamStore` test-only, and a build that names it outside a test fails (kiln's CP-T2.1, T-T2.1.2; Quiver's `crates/quiver/tests/ram_store.rs`) | `0001-ramstore-for-tests-alone-the-write-ahead-log-mandatory.patch` |

The change is Quiver's and kiln's policy, not hyper-raft's, so it isn't offered upstream: hyper-durable
calls `RamStore` slates' case (each write complete as it's submitted), and gating it in hyper-raft
would reach slates. Focal's agent agrees (2026-10-22), and notes that Focal names `RamStore` only in a
test module (`focal-consensus`'s `shell_tests.rs`): sharing this copy, it would ask for `test-store`
as a dev-dependency, as kiln's sync tests do.

## Taking a newer upstream

`python3 scripts/vendor.py hyper-raft <commit>` takes these crates at that commit and re-applies the
change above by three-way merge; take it at the revision Focal's bus takes.
