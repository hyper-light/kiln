//! AC-T7.4.1 (ROOT item 3, the CPU-held scope's exec'd member): a managed scope's member that its watcher
//! holds execs between the hold's token capture and a later signal of that hold. XNU gives a process a new
//! audit-token pid version at exec, so the token names an image the member no longer runs. Each case drives
//! the watcher's own steps in their order (`apply`'s hold, `run_one`'s continue for a read, `stop_again`) on
//! a real member in the scope's group, beside its leader (the controller, as the fixture's), and expects
//! the same process (pid and birth) signalled, held as before, and its scope still Running. And one that
//! ends while held, or before the scope's end reaches it, is let go of, never taken for a process outside
//! the scope.
