//! What the tests' waits take (decision 9 of docs/design/runtime-architecture.md; the person's ruling of 2026-11-13, R03
//! for tests: a wait for a fact waits for the answer). A test's wait for a fact is never refused at its patience: past
//! it, its record or the slowest answer seen for that fact, the run-out is told to the census, once, and the wait goes
//! on to its fact, whose answer is the sample its W* rises to. A party to follow, so a fact that will never come fails
//! its test, is [`follow`]'s; these waits follow their fact alone. What each patience is:
//! - a fact a census row records takes that row's record, here; a program's end through a `Proc` is followed to it,
//!   as the suites follow one (`hex_api::conformance::end_of`);
//! - a fact one node operation makes within itself takes that operation's record, the relation stated where it is
//!   waited for and tested there (a hook holding a create is bounded by the create's answer);
//! - a fact no recorded operation makes is waited for measuring, named `test.<crate>.<fact>`: for the fact alone until
//!   its first answer, then at the slowest seen ([`hex_core::patience::Patience::measuring`]).
//!
//! The tests run debug builds, so each record here is a debug build's (`bench/competitive/probes/waits_census.md`,
//! run 5, waits-census-20261109T184054Z on adacachy2, at ef259dbe): the largest answer of the debug-build arms, the
//! debug arm and the suites', for the row and every test wait seeded from it, never under a bound one ran out at, named
//! by its row, in nanoseconds as the census keeps them. They seed tests' waits alone ([`Patience::seeded`], a test-only
//! constructor): no production wait is seeded from a record (decision 9). [`until`] waits for a fact on a [`Patience`]
//! seeded from one of them or measuring, and [`within`] gives a wait that takes its own deadline none, so it waits for
//! its answer; where the census probe runs the suites (`HEX_WAITS_CENSUS`), every answer goes to its file, so the tests'
//! own waits have rows of their own.
