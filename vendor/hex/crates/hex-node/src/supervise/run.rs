//! Boxes made by a run ([`hex_api::Runtime::run`]): each watched through its program's pidfd, in the
//! supervisor's epoll set, and removed once the program has ended (decision 7 of
//! docs/design/runtime-architecture.md). Whoever meets the end first removes the box: the caller's own
//! wait, which spares the hop through the supervising thread, the supervising thread when no caller
//! waits, or a delete. Each run is claimed once, under the supervisor's lock, and the others wait for what
//! the claimer says, so a box is removed once and never after another box has taken its id: a claimed run
//! stays in view until its claimer has said how the removal went, and a delete of its box waits for that
//! word rather than remove the box beside it (runtime goal 7). The word comes on every path, the claim's
//! drop saying the claimer stopped where it unwound. A run's pidfd is one of the supervisor's, held to its
//! budget with the inits' ([`Supervisor::reserve`]).
