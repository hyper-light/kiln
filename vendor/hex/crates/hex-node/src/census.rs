//! The waits census (`bench/competitive/probes/waits_census.md`; decision 9): with [`ENV_FILE`] naming a file, every
//! answer every named wait in this process records ([`hex_core::patience`]) is appended as `name nanos`
//! (completed wire refusals: `name !nanos`),
//! from the waits' own timing points, so the probe reads each wait's distribution without re-implementing it. With
//! it unset nothing is installed and a wait's answer costs one atomic load more. A bench's switch: the probe sets it.
//!
//! Bounded (CLAUDE.md §2): at most [`ENV_MAX`] lines, which the probe sets from its N; past it one last line says
//! the census is full, and no more is written, so the record says it was cut rather than end silently (§3).
