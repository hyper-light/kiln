//! Joint plan step 14 (AC-T7.4.1; `docs/design/learned-charge.md`): what the scheduler takes of its node's charge
//! learner. The learner lives in the node agent (`crate::node::charges`), the one authority, as the owner of its
//! microVMs' cgroups, and its capacity answers carry what it learned. Each refresh the scheduler gives its node's
//! facts the priors those answers carry (C2), which the placement index books a new VM's receipt at, and books each
//! VM it runs at the holding the answers carry (goal 13's `Driver::rebook`). The node's capacity stays the
//! machine's (C8).
