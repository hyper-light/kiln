//! Conversations, kept per event, replicated and searchable (`docs/conversations.md`): what each
//! agent session said and did, on disk as it happens, so it is resumed exactly after a restart,
//! resumed on another machine, and found again.
//!
//! - [`rows`]: what a session's updates become in the store (no engine in sight).
//! - [`store`]: a machine's store, its writer thread, and the tee that feeds it from the sessions.
//! - [`turso`]: the engine: Turso, embedded.
//! - [`record`]: the harness's own record (transcripts, rollouts), followed into the store.
//! - [`feed`]: a runner's store sent to the server's, over the runner's link.
//! - [`resume`]: a session packed from the server's store, to go on on another machine.
//! - [`mirror`]: runners that keep a copy of the server's store.
//! - [`telemetry`]: what each store and feed is doing, for the System page and its dashboards.
//! - [`board`]: the server's board of every store: their state, series and what happened lately.
